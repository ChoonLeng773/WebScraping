Web-scraping code

Go_learn_url.py is the code that extracts out the URL of all the courses that we are examining 
ccl_coursera_data.csv is the file containing the URL and other course descriptions 

Next web_scrape_test1.py is the code that extracts out all of the reviews for each individual course using the CSV that we have acquired before
